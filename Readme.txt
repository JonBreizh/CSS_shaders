Really quick show off for soon to be CSS filters, not to mistake with CSS-shaders and CSS-vertexs.

Css filters are pretty much html color based effects, soon to be released as part of css3 specificiations. 

As of the writin of these lines, they work only in -webkit- based browsers and sometimes require to active css filter flag.


/*->
Shaders and vertexs are much more in-depth functionnalities used around the CSS custom() property, demo to come out.
